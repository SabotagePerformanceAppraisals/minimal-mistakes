Just today I heard two people give the same naive scaling advice: breaking products into independent pieces for different teams to work on.  This may be the most common advice given, showing a huge blind spot in the Agile coaching and training community.  

Doing this would appear to make life easier for Scrum Teams.  But in the big picture, it actually *reduces* the product development organization's agility.
