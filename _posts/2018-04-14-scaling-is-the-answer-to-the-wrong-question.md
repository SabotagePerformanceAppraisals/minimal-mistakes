If you’ve read one of my favorite 80’s books, _Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy_, you’ll recall it concerns the search for the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.  I’m not giving away much by revealing that answer is merely the number 42.  It turned out that discovering the correct *question* was a more important and difficult problem.

By "scaling Scrum," we usually mean using more than one Scrum Team. About 10 years ago -- when some Scrum trainers had a scaling topic in their CSM classes and some didn't -- there were discussions whether or not this was appropriate in an introductory class.  The argument against sounded reasonable at first, something we still hear today, “You can’t scale what you can’t do.” The argument was that it was necessary to get good at single team Scrum before thinking about how to use multiple teams.  Sounds reasonable, right?

But I think history proves we missed the mark by failing to reframe the “Scaling” topic into *How To Do Scrum In An Organization With More Than Nine People?*

*How To Do Scrum In An Organization With More Than Nine People* is relevant to nearly every class participant I’ve had. Nearly every company "doing Scrum" screws this up.

The problem with "You can't scale what you can't do" is that you also can't do what you can't do.  Most people who come to Scrum classes suffer scale-induced impediments such as these:

* They're parts of component teams (instead of [feature teams](https://less.works/less/structure/feature-teams.html)), or insufficiently cross-functional teams, or other teams that are tiny cogs in a larger traditional process.  In the big picture, they're still doing waterfall.
* They're surrounded by project managers renamed as Product Owners or Scrum Masters.
* They don’t have access to *real* Product Owners.
* They aren't allowed to talk to customers and end users.
* They're shared “resources.”
* They're affected by [harmful HR practices](http://scrumreferencecard.com/WhatHRDoesntKnowAboutScrum_BetterSoftwareMagazine.pdf).
* They're geographically distributed.
* They fail to continuously integrate with other parts of the product.
* They have mountains of [technical debt](/technical-debt-is-the-high-cost-of-future-change).
* They're constantly fixing regression failures and other production emergencies.
* They're making everything worse due to pressure to [increase their velocity](/why-i-barely-mention-velocity-anymore).
* They have [managers who don't understand Agility](/coaching#informed-consent-workshop).

Just teaching single-team Scrum (as rationalized by "You can't scale what you can't do") hasn't helped real Scrum implementations much. Failing to address scale-induced problems opens the door to [monstrous processes like SAFe and Scrum@Scale](/scaling-antipatterns-poster).

Organizations desperately need some of the scaly-ness removed. You can't understand Scrum without realizing its implications for organizational design, both structure and policies. We should teach *descaling organizational complexity* first! But unfortunately we've been miscategorizing those lessons as "scaling Scrum," which provides an excuse not to teach them in introductory (e.g. CSM) classes.
