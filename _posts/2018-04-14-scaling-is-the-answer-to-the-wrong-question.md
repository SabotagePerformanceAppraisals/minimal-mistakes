If you’ve read one of my favorite 80’s books, _Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy_, you’ll recall it concerns the search for the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.  I’m not giving away much by revealing that answer is merely the number 42.  It turned out that discovering the correct *question* was a more important and difficult problem.

By "scaling Scrum," we usually mean using more than one Scrum Team. About 10 years ago, some Scrum trainers had a scaling topic in their CSM classes and some didn't. There were discussions whether or not this was appropriate in an introductory class.  The argument against sounded reasonable at first, something we still hear today, “You can’t scale what you can’t do.” The argument was that it was necessary to get good at single team Scrum before thinking about how to use multiple teams.  Sounds reasonable, right?

But I think history proves we missed the mark by failing to reframe the “Scaling” topic into *How to do Scrum in an organization with more than a dozen people?*

*That* topic is relevant to nearly every class participant I’ve had. The people who come to CSM classes are often parts of component teams (instead of feature teams), or insufficiently cross-functional teams, or other teams that are tiny cogs in a larger traditional process.  They're surrounded by project managers (often renamed as Product Owners or Scrum Masters).  They don’t have access to *real* Product Owners. They aren't allowed to talk to customers. They’re shared “resources.” They have [harmful HR practices](http://scrumreferencecard.com/WhatHRDoesntKnowAboutScrum_BetterSoftwareMagazine.pdf). They're geographically distributed. They have mountains of [technical debt](/technical-debt-is-the-high-cost-of-future-change). They're constantly fixing regression failures and other production emergencies. They're under short term pressure to [increase their velocity](/why-i-barely-mention-velocity-anymore). Just teaching them single-team Scrum without changing their organizations hasn't helped much.

That’s why real Scrum implementations have been so bad (and sometimes codified into [monstrous things like SAFe and Scrum@Scale](/scaling-antipatterns-poster)).  Their organizations desperately need some of the scaly-ness removed. Let's focus on *descaling organizational complexity* instead.
