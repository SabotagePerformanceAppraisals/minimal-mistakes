Scrum (and LeSS) are *intentionally incomplete*, just some feedback loops to aid learning, and some empty space to put the people doing the work back in charge of how they do it.

Unfortunately these gaps often get filled in with things that reduce agility, see [Things Ken Schwaber Intentionally Omits From Scrum](/things-ken-schwaber-intentionally-omits-from-scrum).

Here are some things beyond Scrum that can increase agility:
* [Test Driven Development (TDD)](#try-test-driven-development)
* [mob programming](#try-mob-programming)
* Continuous Integration
* Lean Startup
