title: 'Local Optimization Bias: Here and Now vs. Elsewhere and Later'
---
We human animals naturally think about what’s right in front of us.  We focus on the here and now.  This served us well enough when life was simpler.  But actions also have effects we don't usually consider very well, either due to time -- because they happen later on -- , or distance -- they affect people or things we don't often interact with.

I’ve heard this blind spot called local optimization bias. 

## Example 1

The following video illustrates local optimization in a typical organization.  A supervisor instructs the workers to prevent any unwrapped chocolate from getting past them and into the next room.  The video shows that goal is achieved successfully.  But in the long run and in the big picture, optimizing locally harms the business, its employees, and its customers.  The video is supposed to be funny, but I want you to take it seriously because similar things happen every day in your own company.

## Example 2

During the 1980's I had a brief stint in an IT department.  Our IT department was actually called Information Services & Control (IS&C).  In IS&C, one of my responsibilities was to prevent engineering teams from buying the tools they wanted to use because we could bulk purchase slightly cheaper alternatives that were "almost as good," or to force people to use our unwieldy Univac mainframe.  This is a reasonable argument that could be right in some cases.

My boss produced reports for his boss showing how much money we'd saved the company.  Those people probably all retired thinking this was the right thing to do.  But today I realize what I did to save pennies was actually harmful in the big picture.  *Penny wise, pound foolish* is an example of local optimization bias.

## Example 3

Beginning Scrum Masters, including some book authors, focus on trying to make team  "hyper-productive" instead of helping the product development organization become better able to learn and adapt.

## Example 4

A variation is *branching* in our source code repository.  Whenever someone says "Let's create a feature branch!" or "Let's use Gitflow!" you should hear "Let's delay integration!"
