Watch out for *private code policies and practices*.  Tying particular people or teams to particular parts of the code has several negative impacts:
1. Teams cannot do work in priority order.
2. The code gets worse because fewer people are seeing it, writing tests for it, and refactoring it.
3. Our knowledge and skills do not improve as much as they would when we see other parts of the system.
