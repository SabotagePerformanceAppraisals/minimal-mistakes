![Private code policies](/images/page-15.png)
Watch out for *private code policies and practices*.  Tying particular people or teams to particular parts of the code has several negative impacts:

1. Teams don't work in priority order.  Some teams or individuals do lower valued work, creating *inventory*.  Other teams or individuals become bottlenecks, causing *Work In Progress* (WIP) queues and delaying end-to-end cycle time.
2. The code gets worse.  Fewer people see it, write tests for it, and refactor it.
3. Our knowledge and skills do not improve as much as they would when we see other parts of the system.
4. Ultimately the customer suffers and our company becomes less competitive.
