Q:
> In outsourced Scrum project how can we know the end-product is of the same value of what was originally promised by the contractor (noting the features might be different due to re-prioritisation of the PBI) ?

The track record of outsourced software development is so bad that I would nearly always bet against it having the expected value and acceptable total cost of ownership (TCO) in the long run.
 
If they are not doing TDD (or something similar) the code will not be maintainable.  How do you know they are doing TDD if you're not doing it with them?
 
Also, please understand that software development is [knowledge-creation work](/how-is-knowledge-creation-work-different).  The value produced is the *knowledge*, not just the files the vendor delivers.  Outsourcing leaves valuable knowledge with the vendor instead of with you.

Over the years I've seen this attempted with multiple federal, state, and local government agencies.  It nearly always made me cringe.  It is not just that the long-term costs are so much higher than an agile approach would be, but also that the solutions are late and defective.  The only time I've seen it work well was when we mixed the vendor contractors in with the government employees on the same teams.
