If we want an organization that can quickly adapt to external reality as it's discovered (let's call that _agility_), we need one Product Owner expressing vision and priorities in one list: the Product Backlog.  According to the Scrum Guide, 
> Multiple Scrum Teams often work together on the same product. One Product Backlog is used to describe the upcoming work on the product.

</a>

We sometimes hear the concern that one Product Owner would be overburdened by this, becoming a bottleneck.  Here are the problems I've usually seen causing Product Owner bottleneck:

* _Problem #1:_ The teams are depending on a "Product Owner" for detailed clarifications.  According to <http://agilemanifesto.org> and <http://agilemanifesto.org/principles> we value _customer_ collaboration over contract negotiation, and our highest priority is to satisfy _the customer_ through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.  Therefore Agile teams talk to _customers and users_ for those detailed clarifications.  This is why we show users and stakeholders in [our illustrations of Product Backlog Refinement](https://less.works/less/framework/product-backlog-refinement.html).

* _Problem #2:_ The teams aren't cross functional.  [A cross functional team doesn't only code and test, it also contains business domain expertise, UX/UI skills, etc.](https://youtu.be/e7mzpKHOAHs?t=4m55s)  When I was on a team with a full-time UI designer, we didn't need our Product Owner for every little detail.

* _Problem #3:_ Geographic distribution, better described as *dislocated teams*.

* _Problem #4:_ Often due to problems 1-3, the organization is uncomfortable with delegation.


## Beware Pretend "Product Owners" Who Are Really _Team Output Owners_

A common agility-reducing error is to [ignore Ken Schwaber's advice](https://kenschwaber.wordpress.com/2011/01/31/product-owners-not-proxies/) and artifically designate a team-member as a pretend "Product Owner" even though they're really only a [Team Output Owner](/Why-Scrum-Isnt-Making-Your-Company-Very-Agile).  People who've witnessed the power of team self organization don't advocate special titles for people on our teams.  The Scrum Guide has a good reason to state 
> Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members, regardless of the work being performed by the person.  

And the Agile Manifesto states
> The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. 

It is contradictory to tell a team that [Bob the Business Analyst has special authority over the rest of the team members](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KawTjfX--Eg) while simultaneously telling them to self organize. In the 21st Century, Bob belongs on our self organizing team without a process-imposed role.
