A distinguishing feature of Craig Larman's work (e.g. _Scaling Lean & Agile Development_) is the explicit
focus on a system optimization goal for a change initiative.  Here's an example system optimization goal:

Increase an organization's ability to respond to change.
{: .notice--success}

Craig Larman clarifies:
> tis true that the org design from LeSS is consistent with broad adaptiveness, but... suggest that we coach that adaptiveness is not for its own sake. rather, adaptiveness is in the service of something else: learning towards the discovery and delivery of high value or high impact, in the context of a world in which it's usually difficult to a priori know for sure what is high value/impact, and a world in which competition does stuff, new technologies emerge, new trends emerge, etc.

So, less succinctly:

Increase an organization's ability to discover and deliver the highest value in a world where we don't know everything, and everything's changing.
{: .notice--success}


I'm not seeing any consistent optimization goal in SAFe, Scrum@Scale, the "Spotify model" and the way 
some people explain basic Scrum. 

## Why not just "Make Everything Better"?

*Better* in some ways is *worse* in others.  For example, the goal of *increased customer satisfaction* could be inconsistent 
with *increased stock price this quarter*.  Or another example, I heard a project manager turned Scrum 
trainer say "In my experience, Scrum of Scrums works great!"  And I can see how that could be true, if 
we're optimizing for the sort of problems project managers are usually asked to solve.  But if we're doing 
Scrum to increase agility,
we'll want to consider some [better alternatives](/seven-alternatives-to-scrum-of-scrums/#coordination--integration-what-to-do-instead).


Other explicit or implicit optimization goals that may exist in your organization, which may or may not be consistent with each other:

* resource utilisation or keeping people busy
* Secrecy
* Employee satisfaction
* Customer satisfaction
* Revenue
* Monopolism
* Product versatility
* Improve customer base
* Preserve status quo
* comply with rules/regulations
* lead the market by disruption 
* increase return on investment
* Survive
* Conformance to a plan
