title: "Things Ken Schwaber Intentionally Omits From Scrum"
---
Here are some things that aren't part of Scrum and in some cases actually contradict it.  I'd like you to consider each one and evaluate it for consistency with the [system optimization goal](/you-wont-change-your-organization-without-an-optimization-goal/) of your Agile adoption:
* daily status meeting  
* velocity
* Fibonacci numbers
* Scrum of Scrums
* Scrum Master coordinates/reports/motivates the team
* Scrum Master reports status upward
* tasks in the Product Backlog
* burndown chart as a management report
* "hyperproductivity"
* multiple Product Owners per product (e.g. one per team)
* extra roles

What have I forgotten?

The point of this list is to make sure you're not mindlessly following these because something gave you the idea they are part of Scrum.
