title: "Things Ken Schwaber Intentionally Omits From Scrum"
---
I've listed are some things that are intentionally not part of Scrum, and may contradict it or make it less useful.  

What does it matter?  It's not like the Scrum cops will throw you in jail.  But organizations do things mindlessly -- unintentionally -- because they got the impression they were essential to Scrum.  For each one, please think about what problem it is meant to solve and whether there are solutions more consistent with your [system optimization goal](/you-wont-change-your-organization-without-an-optimization-goal/).

* [velocity](#scrum-does-not-contain-velocity)
* [Story Points, Fibonacci numbers](#scrum-does-not-contain-story-points-and-fibonacci-numbers)
* Scrum of Scrums
* Scrum Master coordinates/reports/motivates the team
* Scrum Master reports status upward
* tasks in the Product Backlog
* burndown chart as a management report
* "hyperproductivity"
* multiple Product Owners per product (e.g. one per team)
* extra roles

Scrum was intended to be a framework, a meta-process, to connect feedback loops and give people control over their own work.  What you've experienced as Scrum in your workplace has likely diverged far from those intentions.

## Scrum Does Not Contain A Daily Status Meeting

According to the [Definition of Scrum](/https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#daily-scrum)

> The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.
> 
> The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work.
> 
> The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.

Do I need to say anything more?  Companies that don't treat the Daily Scrum as a self organization, *re-planning* event are likely to refer to it as a "stand up" where people report status to a manager.

## Scrum Does Not Contain "Velocity"

Schwaber's definition of Scrum has never contained "velocity."  It is a practice sometimes borrowed from Extreme Programming.  But even the Extreme Programming people who came up with the idea now have regrets.  Should you keep doing it?  I'd rather you focused on keeping your product shippable *all the time*.  
See [Why I Barely Mention Velocity Anymore](/why-i-barely-mention-velocity-anymore)

## Scrum Does Not Contain Story Points and Fibonacci numbers

Scrum does not contain any particular effort estimation scheme.  The Scrum Guide barely mentions estimation at all.

Yes, there's a strong case for relative exponential estimates over absolute estimates.  Do you really need a vast array of [Fibonacci numbers](/cult-of-fibonacci)?  You're doing this because someone told you Fibonacci numbers have magical powers?  Do you also believe in astrology?

Cool programmers use powers of two.  And if you're using more than a few choices, you're probably just creating the pretense of precision.
