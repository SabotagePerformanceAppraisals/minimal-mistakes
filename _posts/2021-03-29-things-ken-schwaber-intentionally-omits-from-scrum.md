title: "Things Ken Schwaber Intentionally Omits From Scrum"
---
I've listed are some things that are intentionally not part of Scrum, and may contradict it or make it less useful.  

What does it matter?  It's not like the Scrum cops will throw you in jail.  
But organizations do things mindlessly -- unintentionally -- because they got the impression 
they were essential to Scrum.  For each one, please think about
what problem it is meant to solve and whether there are solutions more
consistent with your [system optimization goal](/you-wont-change-your-organization-without-an-optimization-goal/).

* daily status meeting  
* velocity
* Fibonacci numbers
* Scrum of Scrums
* Scrum Master coordinates/reports/motivates the team
* Scrum Master reports status upward
* tasks in the Product Backlog
* burndown chart as a management report
* "hyperproductivity"
* multiple Product Owners per product (e.g. one per team)
* extra roles

What have I forgotten?

## Scrum Does Not Contain A Daily Status Meeting

According to the [Definition of Scrum](/https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#daily-scrum)

The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.

## Scrum Does Not Contain "Velocity"

Schwaber's definition of Scrum has never contained "velocity."  It is a practice sometimes borrowed from Extreme Programming.  
But even the people who came up with the idea have regrets about it.  
See [Why I Barely Mention Velocity Anymore](/why-i-barely-mention-velocity-anymore)
