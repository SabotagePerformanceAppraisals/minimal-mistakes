title: "How is Knowledge Work Different?"
---
The fundamental constraint of knowledge work -- such as software development -- is our ability to can discover or create knowledge.

Imagine that you had spent Monday through Thursday working on an essay, a song, or even a computer program. You tore up seven ways that you realized wouldn’t work. You took a walk outside. You slept on it. You did research and found an eighth way that looked like it would work, until you showed it to a friend who pointed out a serious flaw with one part of your idea. By Thursday afternoon you had nearly finished a ninth way that combined the best of your previous approaches and looked to be nearly done. Then Thursday night your cat walked across the keyboard and somehow deleted your entire Git repository.

Would it take you another four days to get back to where you were? Of course not! By 10AM Friday you’d be ahead of where you were Thursday night. Therefore what was the actual constraint on that knowledge work? It wasn’t the typing. It was the knowledge creation, the learning.

Have you ever noticed that companies with lots of money and people can't seem to develop software that works very well?  I know interns who can make better websites than certain airlines can.  Those shops aren't built for learning.  They're organized as if software development is just about typing code.
