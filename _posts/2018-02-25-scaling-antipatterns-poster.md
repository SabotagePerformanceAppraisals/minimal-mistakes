Scrum was supposed to be about teams self organizing around shared priorities and vision.
It replaced defined "methodologies" with empirical inspect and adapt feedback loops.

Unfortunately *methodology creep* seems to be inevitable.  I originally made this poster
to help other Scrum trainers understand the harm they cause when they insert
unnecessary roles and hierarchy into the spaces where self organization was supposed
to be.

We want one shared vision from one Product Owner, not multiple competing priority lists.
We want fluid, role-free interactions between the teams, not Scrum Masters acting as 
coordinators.

Feel free to download the poster above.
