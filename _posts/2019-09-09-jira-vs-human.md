I walked into a Backlog Refinement session with one person typing at a keyboard, a couple people interacting with him, and everyone else looking bored.  We wrote the items on large Post-It Notes and put them on walls and tables instead.  I scattered a bunch of blanks around the room.  Just these changes seemed to bring it to life.  Everyone got up and started interacting with the backlog and each other.
