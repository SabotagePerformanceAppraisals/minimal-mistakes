I have only seen this work once, when SMs and POs met 3 times a week to share their premeditated conversations and working agreements at a feature level, frequently it descends into a round robin project update or a mind numbingly boring task level detailed update meeting where PMs confuse and confound each other.

I'll start with the most practical link in this article.  If you're in a hurry, just go to the overview of the seven alternatives here:

## Short History of Scrum of Scrums

Ken Schwaber and Mike Beedle published the first Scrum book in 2001.  We called it "The Black Book" because of its obnoxious cover.  They had a lot of abstract theory and just a bit of practical experience how to make Scrum work in a small context, but much less to say about multi-team endeavors.   In what strikes me as almost an afterthought, The Black Book contained the idea of Scrum Masters from multiple teams meeting with each other regularly.  It had the catchy name "Scrum of Scrums," reflecting the seductive fractal symmetry of the idea.

Ken Schwaber wrote his best book in 2004: _Agile Project Management With Scrum_, aka "The Grey Book."  Skip The Black Book, read the modern _Scrum Guide_, but you don't really get Scrum's strengths and limitations if you haven't read The Grey Book.  Unfortunately this book still included Scrum of Scrums, but with the improvement of sending team representatives (explicitly "engineers" in his 2007 book) instead of Scrum Masters.  But the last page of the book (before the Appendices) contains this fascinating self critique: 

> When I [Schwaber] presented these case studies at a meeting of ScrumMasters in Milan in June 2003, Mel Pullen pointed out that he felt that the Scrum of Scrums practice was contrary to the Scrum practice of self-organization and self-management. Hierarchical structures are management impositions, Mel asserted, and are not optimally derived by those who are actually doing the work. Why not let each Team figure out which other Teams it has to cooperate and coordinate with and where the couplings are? Either the ScrumMaster can point out the dependency to the Team, or the Team can come across the dependency in the course of development. When a Team stumbles over the dependency, it can send people to serve as “chickens” [uncommitted participants] on the Daily Scrum of the other Team working on the dependency. If no such other Team exists, the Team with the unaddressed dependency can request that a high-priority Product Backlog item be created to address it. The ScrumMaster can then either let the initial Team tackle the dependency or form another Team to do so.

> This was an interesting observation. Scrum relies on self-organization as well as simple, guiding rules. Which is more applicable to coordinate and scale projects? I’ve tried both and found that the proper solution depends on the complexity involved. When the complexity is so great that self-organization doesn’t occur quickly enough, simple rules help the organization reach a timely resolution. If self-organization occurs in a timely manner, I prefer to rely on it because management is unlikely to devise adaptations as frequently or well as the Team can. Sometimes the ScrumMaster can aid self-organization by devising a few simple rules, but it is easier for the ScrumMaster to overdo it than not do enough.

Ken's CSM training materials from this time on reflect the understanding that the Scrum Master should have no authority over the team.  I have not found any reference to Scrum of Scrums in the materials he gave me to train with.

At a Scrum Gathering (probably Stockholm in late 2007), Ken publicly disavowed Scrum of Scrums.  In a discussion group many years later, Mike Beedle expressed regret for the Black Book's recommendation of using Scrum Masters as team representatives.

In 2008, Jeff Sutherland reappeared on the scene and would resume claiming to have "invented" Scrum.

## Why Scrum of Scrums Continued After Ken Disavowed It

I guess Scrum of Scrums is a catchy, sticky idea and other trainers (including influential Mike Cohn and  Jeff Sutherland) kept teaching it and writing about it because Scrum had so few answers for large organizations.  It is not in the *Scrum Guide*, but it is in the two top-marketed approaches to scaling.  It's semi-discouraged in LeSS (the least marketed approach to scaling) because we keep finding alternatives that are better at increasing an organization's ability to learn and adapt.
