title: 'Software Development Misconception #1: Dependencies In Knowledge Work Are Caused By Immutable Laws Of Physics'
---
I sometimes think Bas Vodde is being too harsh when he writes "Keep the project managers away from the teams!"

And then I see a statement like this on LinkedIn, written by some poor fool who is also a self-described program manager with no apparent understanding of how software development (indeed, all knowledge work) is different from physical construction.

It starts with a false analogy, showing the incorrect mental model of someone who has not written software in a modern way:

> People who think that dependencies are just figments of old-style thinking should convince me by first putting on a shoe and tying the laces, then putting on a sock that goes between their bare foot and the tied shoe without removing the shoe.
>
> My projects and products are a lot more complicated than shoes and socks.

In knowledge work, “dependencies” are not caused by immutable laws of physics. The perceived need to plan around them through multiple Sprints is a symptom of obsolete organizational structure, policy, and skills. This should be directly addressed rather than institutionalized with the waterfall dependency management that masquerades as Agile scaling.  This program manager inadvertently demonstrates that dependencies *are* figments of old-style thinking.
