title: "JIRA and The Deckard Defense"

Here's a familiar pattern: An experienced observer notes that a certain tool, mental model, or practice should be avoided because it is causing more harm than good in the industry.  Then a someone reflexively responds with _The Deckard Defense_: "Thing X can be used for good or bad."  (Deckard is a character in [Blade Runner](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/).)

The Deckard Defense is logically valid, but misses the point that Thing X _usually_ has a harmful effect, and removing it _usually_ has a beneficial effect.

While I've heard this argument used to defend [velocity](/why-i-barely-mention-velocity-anymore), burndown charts, and [Scrum of Scrums](/seven-alternatives-to-scrum-of-scrums/), it most frequenly comes up around tools like JIRA.

JIRA is particularly harmful to collaboration when used for the _Sprint Backlog_, the work a team has chosen to do during one Sprint.  Even if there's a shared Product Backlog in some electronic tool (ideally something much simpler than JIRA), the Sprint Backlog is meant to belong to the _team_ that's working on it.  Unfortunately you can't spend much time in a JIRA-based shop without hearing people talk about "my ticket" and "your ticket."
