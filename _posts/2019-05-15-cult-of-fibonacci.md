Scrum was supposed to help team start with the simplest thing that could possibly work.  And then add complexity only as proven needed for their situation. 

Let's take estimation.  Everywhere I go, teams are using a wide range of Fibonacci numbers such as 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 ... on until ridiculously high numbers). Some teams may really need a large range of Fibonacci numbers.  But the fact that *nearly all* are using this shows we trainers/coaches have failed to teach teams to experiment with their own methods.  I have even heard trainers claim that we should use the Fibonacci sequence because of "science."

Despite what you may have been taught, Fibonacci numbers do not have magical powers.  A team that starts with the simplest thing and adds complexity only as proven needed might also try:
* [#NoEstimates](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoEstimates?src=hash), or
* very simple estimates (e.g. Small vs. Not Small), or
* a simple range such as *1, 2, 4, TOO BIG*, or
* using only a small subset of the usual Fibonacci scale.  Consider throwing away the other cards!

From a development team perspective, the only estimate that matters is whether an item will fit into a Sprint or not.  Anything bigger than 1/4 of a Sprint is almost definitely too big.  

For others, such as the Product Owner and other stakeholders, estimates *might* help provide forecasts about when particular Product Backlog Items will be done in future Sprints.  But being Agile is about being adaptable, including changing the requirements.  We want to be able to change business directions as we learn more about customer needs.  Don't forget [Terry's Agility Index](https://less.works/blog/courses/2016/04/19/terry-agility-index.html), which posits that our original plan was probably wrong anyway.  Scrum teams strive to keep the product shippable at all times.  When we're delivering continuously, people don't seem to worry about estimates as much.
