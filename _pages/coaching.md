> In the early 2000s I was a developer in a small company that had learned a lot about doing
> Scrum and the related technical practices. We discovered one of our product customers was a local
> organization with multiple teams struggling to do Scrum.  So we visited them, observed how they
> worked, mob programmed with them, and eventually made some subtle suggestions that seemed to make
> an impact.  Collaboration improved, code quality improved, and soon the product was shippable every
> two weeks.  And so we thought, "Wow! Consulting is easy!"
>
> Months later, the teams had starved their backlog because political issues prevented them from
> talking to customers and end users.  Morale dropped, the strongest developers got bored and left,
> and they were right back where they started.  Eventually the whole project got cancelled.
>
> A couple years later we were contracted to train hundreds of people for an e-commerce company.
> We knew how to help the teams perform better, but it quickly became clear that __team performance
> was only a tiny factor in that organization's ability to adapt__.  The way the teams were organized,
> the way people outside the teams tried to coordinate their work, the HR policies, the dozens of junior
> "Product Owners" and "Product Backlogs" didn't look any better than traditional waterfall development
> to us. The organization did not become more adaptable and today they continue to lose market share.
>
> Eventually I had the opportunity to learn __systems thinking__ from [Jerry Weinberg](https://www.amazon.com/Gerald-M.-Weinberg/e/B000AP8TZ8) and developed the habit of looking at the
bigger picture.

## Informed Consent Workshop

The best outcomes we've been involved with were both _top down_ and _bottom up_.  Agility is
a greater opportunity and challenge for the entire organization than training sponsors often
realize at first.  Let's get together with a cross section of senior management, HR, developers,
and intermediate (e.g. project/program) managers and discuss the likely implications for your
organization.
