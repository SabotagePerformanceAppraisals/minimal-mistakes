> In the early 2000s I was a developer in a small company that had learned a lot about doing
> Scrum and the related technical practices. We discovered one of our product customers was a local
> organization with multiple teams struggling to do Scrum.  So we visited them, observed how they
> worked, mob programmed with them, and eventually made some subtle suggestions that seemed to make
> an impact.  Collaboration improved, code quality improved, and soon the product was shippable every
> two weeks.  And so we thought, "Wow! Consulting is easy!"

> Months later, the teams had starved their backlog because political issues prevented them from
> talking to customers and end users.  Morale dropped, the strongest developers got bored and left,
> and they were right back where they started.  Eventually the whole project got cancelled.

> the way people outside the teams tried to coordinate their work, the HR policies, the dozens of junior
> "Product Owners" and "Product Backlogs" didn't look any better than traditional waterfall development
> to us. The organization did not become more adaptable and today they continue to lose market share.

bigger picture.

## Informed Consent Workshop

The best Agile adoptions we've been involved with were both _top down_ and _bottom up_.

Agility is a greater opportunity and challenge for the entire organization than training sponsors
realize at first.
{: .notice--danger}

Let's get together with a cross section of senior management, HR, developers,
and intermediate (e.g. project/program) managers and discuss the likely implications for your
organization.

## (Team) Sprint Retrospective Facilitation

According to [Roger Schwarz](https://www.amazon.com/Skilled-Facilitator-Comprehensive-Consultants-Facilitators/dp/0787947237), a facilitator should be

1. acceptable to all members of the group,
1. substantively neutral, and
1. not have substantive decision making authority.

Schwarz writes that _the facilitator can meet these three criteria only if he or she is not a group member_.
While we would like you to develop these capabilities internally (e.g. with full-time Scrum Masters), in the
beginning or at crucial times it can be better to enlist outside help.

## Overall Retrospective Facilitation

When more than one team works on a product, they are more likely to develop a _whole product view_ by following their
separate (Team) Sprint Retrospectives with a cross-team
[Overall Retrospective](https://less.works/less/framework/overall-retrospective.html). This is for team members
(or representative samples of them), Scrum Masters, the Product Owner, and management to inspect and adapt the
entire product development system. A neutral outsider can use systems modeling, casual loop diagramming, and 
large group facilitation techniques to help make these discussions productive.
