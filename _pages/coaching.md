## Informed Consent Workshop

The most common complaint we hear in trainings is "Why isn't my manager in this class?"  At least
one third of the challenges that participants raise in training are things we'd like management's
help with.

The best Agile adoptions we've been involved with were both _top down_ and _bottom up_.

WARNING: Agility is a greater opportunity -- and greater challenge -- for the entire organization than training sponsors
realize at first.
{: .notice--danger}

The informed consent workshop is a get together with a cross section of senior management, HR, 
developers, and intermediate managers (e.g. program managers, project managers, department heads). 
We will discuss current pain points, what's gone wrong with previous improvement initiatives, what
pitfalls and setbacks are likely ... all the icky stuff. Bring samples of your source code if you
like.  Please be prepared to discuss what you want to optimize your organization for, and what you 
think your organization must give up to move toward that optimization goal.

## (Team) Sprint Retrospective Facilitation

Whether your methods are influenced by Scrum, Kanban, XP, waterfall, LeSS, or all/none of the above, 
we want teams to *own* their processes and methods, not *rent* them.

An effective retrospective -- one that leads to shared understanding and durable agreements -- allows
sufficient discussion of objective questions, reflective questions, introspective questions before
moving into decisional questions.  An effective facilitator is a skillful listener who creates 
space for viewpoints from the entire group, not only the most confident.

According to [Roger Schwarz](https://www.amazon.com/Skilled-Facilitator-Comprehensive-Consultants-Facilitators/dp/0787947237), a facilitator should be

1. acceptable to all members of the group,
1. substantively neutral, and
1. not have substantive decision making authority.

Schwarz writes that _the facilitator can meet these three criteria only if he or she is not a group member_.


While we would like you to eventually develop facilitation capabilities internally (e.g. with 
your own Scrum Masters), in the
beginning or at crucial times it can be better to enlist outside help.  This is a cost-effective
option for situations that do not need a full-time coach.

## Overall Retrospective Facilitation

When more than one team works on a product, they are more likely to develop a _whole product view_ by following their
separate (Team) Sprint Retrospectives with a cross-team
[Overall Retrospective](https://less.works/less/framework/overall-retrospective.html). This is for team members
(or representative samples of them), Scrum Masters, the Product Owner, and management to inspect and adapt the
entire product development system. A neutral outsider can use systems modeling, causal loop diagramming, and 
large group facilitation techniques to help make these discussions productive.

## Product Backlog Refinement (aka. Backlog Grooming) Facilitation

Organizations struggle to capture user needs in their product backlogs in ways that
lend themselves to adaptability, reduced work-in-progress (WIP), and short schedules.
Are you struggling with user stories, epics, traditional requirements, and dependencies?
We can help you identify *thin vertical slices* of customer value work.
