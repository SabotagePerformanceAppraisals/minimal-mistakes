CSM (Certified Scrum Master) Training
-------------------------------------

Main topics covered primarily by team activities and examples (any lectures would be very short):

* Three Scrum roles, responsibilities, boundaries, in depth.
* How to write well formed Product Backlog Items such as user stories.
* Techniques for splitting large requirements (e.g. epics) into small specific ones.
* Product Backlog prioritization.
* Effort estimation.
* Maintaining the Sprint Backlog.
* Five Scrum meetings (how to, how not to).
* Sprint execution for self organizing teams.
* Definition of done and the potentially-shippable product increment.
* Environments that encourage or impede team self organization.
* Small group dynamics (the psychology of innovative teams).
* Modern Agile engineering practices including test-driven development (TDD).
* Lean principles derived from the Toyota Production System.
* Product Owner planning and forecasting beyond one Sprint.
* Case studies of Scrum in large organizations.
* Case studies of Scrum for large scale development.
* Case studies of common organizational impediments.

The class contains individual and group knowledge tests that precede the ScrumAlliance's online test.

Better prepared groups are able to spend more time on the advanced topics.
